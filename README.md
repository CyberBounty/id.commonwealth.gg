Token Type: ERC-20

Ticker Symbol: PNT

Blockchain: Ethereum Classic (ETC)

Smart Contract: 0xDe6FB6a5adbe6415CDaF143F8d90Eb01883e42ac

About: Commonwealth is a peer-to-peer algorithmic bank that mints P3C via a smart contract. When ETC is deposited or withdrawn from the contract a 10% dividend is paid proportionally and instantly to every holder. This micro-dividend is used to provide long term income stability to those without access to banks across the world. It is also used as a currency for online applications and to pay for things.
